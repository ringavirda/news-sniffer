# News-sniffer

Old web app, I tried to update it to modern versions but who knows if it still works or not. It was supposed to listen into several news outlets, gather data in forms of articles and process them in some way to produce some metrics about population energy and mood.

There are a lot of bad code here, so let it be a monument to how bad I was before.

Front-end uses Angular and back-end is .Net, if you want to try to run it.
